## Dave and Sabina's Stories in Emails Over Twelve Years

When asked to quantify some aspect of my life through visualizing a dataset personal to me, I immediately thought of the great volume of emails my friend Dave (name changed) and I have exchanged over the course of twelve years. I have generally avoided looking back at these; Dave is far more interested in hoarding what he calls time bubbles than I am, and I only possess the emails because Gmail saves them, but now that I think of them as visualizable data, questions jump to my mind. Who wrote most emails? In which years did we write a lot, when did we write less, and what was happening in our lives at those times?

The story told by the 2,627 emails that I downloaded from my Gmail account reveals the tenacity of a friendship that prevailed through the thick and the thin of major life events. It is a story that interests me personally because I am at the center of it, but it is also a good story about trauma and recovery that may interest and inspire viewers who, like myself and Dave, had or have to struggle to finish college and took or are taking a long time to do this.

I have used the 1,406 emails from Dave to me and the 1,221 emails from me to him since November 2006 to graph our emails over time. I have annotated peaks and valleys with information about what was happening in our lives at those times.

I chose to visualize Daveâ€™s and my emails exchange with a line graph because this layout allows the eye to trace our movements over time while leaving enough space above and below the lines to add short annotations. I was surprised to see that Dave only sent me 185 fewer emails than I sent him, and particularly intrigued by the peaks and valleys in the lines our emails draw. 

Downloading data from my Google account was easy; I watched a How.ToGuides.com tutorial on Youtube and soon had my data in an .mbox file on my PC. Converting this file to .csv so that Tableau Public could read it was much more complicated than I had anticipated and after spending hours trying to convert it in Github with Python (I have not a clue how to write or read Python) and any number of other conversion methods, I reached out and asked Erin and Michelle for help. They converted the data in the wink of an eye and Tableau automatically organized it. The data still needed some tweaking for the purposes of the visualization I wanted to build, so I went into the .csv file and cleaned it up. Cleaning was time consuming and at times a challenge despite my familiarity with excel but satisfying when I started to be able to use my data set. 

I showed Dave what I was doing and we plan to get together to add all kinds of things, including photographs, links, poems and songs to the visualization and turn it into a real digital scrap book. Maybe I will become a hoarder yet.
