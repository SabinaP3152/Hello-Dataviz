I did this project in 2018 for my first class in data visualization. I am fond of the donuts I used, and they still seem to me the best possible way to visualize 56 years of New York Public Theater Free Shakespeare in the Park. I built the donuts with Tableau Public, which doesn't of itself do donuts, by placing a small pie chart on top of a larger one.
