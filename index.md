This project visualizes 56 years of New York Public Theater Free Shakespeare in the Park. I made this visualization in 2018 because I wanted to know how frequently King John has been performed in the park in comparison to other plays. The donuts I used still seem to me the best possible way to visualize these 56 years of plays. I made the donuts with Tableau Public, which doesn't do donuts (or at least didn't do donuts in 2018), by placing a small pie chart on top of a larger one.
